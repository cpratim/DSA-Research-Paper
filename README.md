# How are new changes in foul rules affecting NBA offense?

## Introduction

One of the most important aspects of basketball has been the shooting foul and the free throw shot. Throughout NBA history, 
free throws have decided games — especially in close situations. During the 2020-21 NBA season, in games decided by 10 points or 
less, the team that had more free throw attempts (FTA) won the game 60% of the time, with an r-value of .26 between free throw 
attempts and point differential.

Due to the significance of the free throw, especially during close games, NBA players often “foul hunt,” or intentionally 
draw fouls. Whether that means exaggerating contact on the court or purposefully propelling themselves into defenders, foul 
hunting results in referees calling fouls in situations where most fans don’t believe a foul took place. Due to pressure from 
fans and players alike, the NBA announced during the 2021 off-season that there will be “an interpretive change in the 
officiating of overt, abrupt or abnormal non-basketball moves by offensive players with the ball in an effort to draw fouls.” In 
addition to the new rules on shooting fouls, the NBA has also allowed more aggressive defensive play. This paper will discuss how 
these officiating changes have altered offensive production thus far in the 2021-22 NBA regular season.
